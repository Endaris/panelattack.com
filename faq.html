<p class="q" id="0"><span class="q">Q:</span>  I messed up my controls in Panel Attack, and now it's going crazy.  Help?</p>
<p><span class="a">A:</span>  You need to close Panel Attack and delete the file that saves your input settings.
On windows, you can type this into the start menu search to get to the right folder:

<div class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</div>

then delete <span class="code">keys.txt</span>

Thanks to gamerX459 for making a <a href="https://youtu.be/aQK0MKbNSkA">video demonstration</a> of how to fix the above problem.

<div id="1">
<p class="q" id="1"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I set Player 2's controls for local play in Panel Attack?</p>
<p><span class="a">A:</span>  While in the place for setting Player 1's controls, press right to get to Player 2's controls.
</p>
</div>

<div id="2">
<p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I have two computers.  Can I use the same Panel Attack ranking system user_id on both, so all my matches get tracked to the same account?</p>
<p><span class="a">A:</span>  Yes, please do.
<br>After you've logged into the Panel Attack server(s) once on your first computer, copy your "servers" folder to the appropriate location on your other computer.
<br>Here are the folder locations, per operating system.
<br><br>NOTE: replace "user" with whatever your operating system username is.
<br>Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista: <span class="code">C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Panel Attack</span> or search for <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</span>
<br>Mac: <span class="code">/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Panel Attack</span>
<br>Linux: <span class="code">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Panel Attack</span>
<br>Windows XP <span class="code">C:\Documents</span> and <span class="code">Settings\user\Application Data\Panel Attack</span>
<br>This folder contains your user_ids for each server, which Panel Attack uses to log in to the ranking system.

<div id="3">
<p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> The game seems to be going too fast!</p>

<p><span class="a">A:</span> The menus may go too fast if you have a monitor that has a refresh rate greater than 60hz.  We released an update to fix this mid April 2019, redownload the game if you haven't already since then.
<br><br>Gameplay should be normal though.  If the FPS counter shows about 60 during gameplay, and it seems like it's going too fast, it could be that you've set your L or R button (raise stack button) to a pressure sensitive trigger, and the game thinks you are constantly pressing that button.  This happens especially on Xbox controllers.  Use a button such as a bumper instead of a trigger.

<div id="4">
<p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I access replays?</p>

<p><span class="a">A:</span> This process is not very smooth yet... but here's how you do it:
<br><br>Replays of all the games your client has played or spectated are stored as .txt files on your computer in <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>
<br>Publicly saved replays are <a href="replays/">stored here</a>. You can adjust whether your replays are saved publicly in the Panel Attack options menu.
They are arranged into folders by Panel Attack version, then date (UTC time), then player names.
<br><br>Once you have the .txt file for the replay you want to watch, copy it to <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</span>, delete the "replay.txt" file, and rename the replay you want to watch as replay.txt. Then re-launch Panel Attack.
<br><br>Next choose "Replay of 2P vs" from the main menu.  Of course, if you just want to watch your last replay, this last step is all you have to do.
