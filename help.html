          <div>
            <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I messed up my controls in Panel Attack, and now it's going crazy. Help?
            </p>
            <p><span class="a">A:</span> You need to close Panel Attack and delete the file that saves your input settings.
              On windows, you can type this into the start menu search to get to the right folder:

            <div class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</div>

            then delete <span class="code">keysV2.txt</span>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I set Player 2's controls for local play in Panel Attack?</p>

          <div>
            <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I have two computers. Can I use the same Panel Attack ranking system
              user_id on both, so all my matches get tracked to the same account?</p>
            <p><span class="a">A:</span> Yes, please do.
              <br>After you've logged into the Panel Attack server(s) once on your first computer, copy your "servers"
              folder to the appropriate location on your other computer.
              <br>Here are the folder locations, per operating system.
              <br><br>NOTE: replace "user" with whatever your operating system username is.
              <br>Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista: <span class="code">C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Panel Attack</span> or search
              for <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</span>
              <br>Mac: <span class="code">/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Panel Attack</span>
              <br>Linux: <span class="code">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Panel Attack</span> or <span
                class="code">~/.local/share/love/</span>

              system.

          <div>
            <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I access replays?</p>

            <p><span class="a">A:</span>Replays of all the games your client has played or spectated are stored as .txt files on your computer
              in <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>
              <br>Publicly saved replays are <a href="replays/" target="_blank">stored here</a>. You can adjust whether your
              replays are saved publicly in the Panel Attack options menu.
              They are arranged into folders by Panel Attack version, then date (UTC time), then player names.
              <br><br>Once you have the .txt file for the replay you want to watch, copy it to <span
                class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>, then relaunch panel attack and find it with the Replay
              Browser at the main menu.

          <div>
            <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> Panel Attack only shows a black screen, what can I do?</p>
            
            <p><span class="a">A:</span> The AMD 22.7.1 graphics driver is known to cause rendering problems with all LOVE2D games, including Panel Attack.
