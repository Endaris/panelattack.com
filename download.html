        <h1>Setting up Panel Attack on Mac, Linux or Android</h1>
        <p>Download and install love2d 11.4 for Mac or your distribution of Linux (use the .AppImage file if you are unsure), or the android.apk:<br class="clear">
          <a href="https://github.com/love2d/love/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/love2d/love/releases</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can then download the windows release of Panel Attack, unzip it, and change the file extension of the
          panel.exe from .exe to .love. </p>
        <p>On your Mac, or Linux machine you should be able to double-click it to run it after that.</p>
        <p>On Android, use a file browser to open panel.love and choose the love2d app when prompted which app to open the
          file with. Some file browser apps on Android do not offer this option so you may have to install a different one,
          e.g. X-plore.
